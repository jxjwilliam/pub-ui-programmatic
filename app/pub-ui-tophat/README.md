## About

Tophat is an opensource UI component library enabling consistent styling across applications and products while [decoupling the presentation layer](https://github.com/PubMatic/tophat/wiki/Problem-Definition).

Tophat seeks to [turbocharge design and engineering teams](https://github.com/PubMatic/tophat/wiki/Proposed-solution), bringing the focus to [building innovations](https://github.com/PubMatic/tophat/wiki/Solution-benefits), not another button.
